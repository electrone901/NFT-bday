# Education NFT
Education NFT is an educational platform that helps students, professors, institutions,  philanthropists and people to protect their intellectual ideas through a decentralized and transparent way using blockchain technology to document their journey from start to finish.

Education NFT allows people to achieve their educational dreams by
Connecting them with the right people, investor and mentors
Providing them with the necessary tools and resources
Allowing Individual/Institutions to fund student projects for further education and research support
Creates the opportunity for students to secure their projects as NFT

Data gathering with IPFS, analysis and learning pathway suggestions to develop more successful people





### How does it work?
It's a simple process, just come up with a project/idea, start building, and get fund it. Make your dream come true and let the world discover your talent.
Share your idea with the world:
Share your awesome idea, project, research, or mission so others can financially support or contribute.
Get a Non Fungible Token
Each idea is represented as an NFT that holds your valuable work and ideas.
Find contributors, investors, and mentors.
Invite people, makers, mentors, and expert advisors to your project. Anyone can see ideas, but only members who purchase your idea NFT can access the community.
Get fund it
Offer potential funders incentives to invest in your idea.



### Future
In the future we would like to implement:
Support students for their education by offering grants, scholarships and more.


### Why Did I use IPFS?
I wanted to use IPFS to design a simple and fun app where everyone can collaborate, learn about NFTs and experience them directly.

### How it's made?
NFT Pixels application makes use of the following software:

NFTStorage: the data is stored on NFTStorage IPFS, the generated hash (CID) will be used to view the details and to retrieve the NFT.

- ​​ NFTPort for multi-chain NFT minting, and data transparency such as  distributing rewards and minting the NFT.

-  Unlock for giving the user access to exclusive content


- Solidity: Solidity was used for the smart contract together with OpenZeppelin ERC721 for faster development of the smart contract

- Ganache: for local blockchain development

- Polygon, Matic Network: the network I deployed the app.

- Frontend: React Js for the frontend, Material-UI, and Web3 to connect to the blockchain.

# How it's made
NFT Pixels application makes use of the following softwares:

### `NFTStorage` for data storage on IPFS that generates a transation hash used to retrive the NFT .

### `Solidity` for the smart contract

### `OpenZeppelin ERC721` we use the ERC721 template for a faster development of the smart contract

### `Ganache` for local blockchain development

### `Polygon, Matic Network` the network I deployed the app

### `React Js, Material-ui, Web3` React Js for the frontend, Material-ui and Web3 to connect to blockchain.

### `Unlock Protocol` to allow users to pay for exclusive content this protocol was a big part of our use case.

# Getting Started

### `yarn start`

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
